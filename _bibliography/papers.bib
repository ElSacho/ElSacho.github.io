  title={Minimum volume conformal sets for multivariate regression},
  author={Braun, Sacha and Aolaritei, Liviu and Jordan, Michael I and Bach, Francis},
  abstract={Conformal prediction provides a principled framework for constructing predictive sets with finite-
sample validity. While much of the focus has been on univariate response variables, existing mul-
tivariate methods either impose rigid geometric assumptions or rely on flexible but computation-
ally expensive approaches that do not explicitly optimize prediction set volume. We propose an
optimization-driven framework based on a novel loss function that directly learns minimum-volume
covering sets while ensuring valid coverage. This formulation naturally induces a new nonconfor-
mity score for conformal prediction, which adapts to the residual distribution and covariates. Our
approach optimizes over prediction sets defined by arbitrary norm ballsâ€”including single and multi-
norm formulations. Additionally, by jointly optimizing both the predictive model and predictive
uncertainty, we obtain prediction sets that are tight, informative, and computationally efficient, as
demonstrated in our experiments on real-world datasets.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
