Hi !

I am a first year PhD student under the supervision of Francis Bach and Michael I. Jordan at INRIA (Sierra, Paris). I work on uncertainty quantification, with a strong interest in conformal prediction. 

Since popularizing science has helped me develop an appetence for the sciences, I want to develop popularization videos on Machine Learning topics that are accessible to all levels. I'm currently working on a series aimed at making the [AlphaZero](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10045895/1/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf) algorithm understandable to everyone.

Previously, I created an online mathematic course that you can access for free on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uniwebebraun5130). On the account, I corrected many exercices from Licence 1 to Licence 3, covering Probability, Algebra, Calculus and Complex Analysis. I also made some presentation about some mathematics concepts such as fractal or markov chain. 

Outside work, I enjoy cooking (especially Japanese cuisine!), and climbing.
