Hi !

I'm a fourth and final year student at Ã‰cole Polytechnique (X2020). For my last year, I will attend a master degree from ENS Paris-Saclay in mathematics, vision and machine learning (MVA). I have a particular interest in Reinforcement Learning.

I am currently doing a research internship in Tokyo, in Cluster Inc. Lab, where I work on black-box function approximation using bandits.

Previously, I created an online mathematic course that you can access for free on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@uniwebebraun5130). On the account, I corrected many exercices from Licence 1 to Licence 3, covering Probability, Algebra, Calculus and Complex Analysis. I also made some presentation about some mathematics concepts such as fractal or markov chain. 

Since popularizing science has helped me develop an appetence for the sciences, I want to develop popularization videos on Machine Learning topics that are accessible to all levels. I'm currently working on a series aimed at making the [AlphaZero](https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10045895/1/agz_unformatted_nature.pdf) algorithm understandable to everyone.

Outside work, I enjoy cooking (especially Japanese cuisine!), and climbing.
