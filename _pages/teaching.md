I have been assistant professor for the course [Convex Optimization](https://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/OptConvexeM2.html) at the MVA given by Alexandre d'Aspremont & Adrien Taylor.

You can see my other website [here](https://sachauniwebe.wixsite.com/website), and check my youtube account [here](https://www.youtube.com/@uniwebebraun5130). 

I also wrote a subject for an exam in analysis, [check it out !](/assets/pdf/sujet_analyse_3.pdf)
